Our Cup
=======

A quick web tool that suggests World Cup games to watch in your community based on
foreign-born populations. This combines US Census data, with a match schedule to suggest
the best games to watch based on the population of people near where you live.

Dependencies
------------

For data generation you need Python 3 and jupyter. See the `census-data` folder.

I also did exploratory visualization and data analysis in
[an Observable notebook](https://observablehq.com/d/62390c8bd663ff6f).

Deploying
---------

This is built to deploy to a flat HTML server. I deployed it via GitHub Pages for
the free hosting.
